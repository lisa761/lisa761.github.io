          <div class="post-content"><p>So my computer science journey started at the age of 15 - when I took it as a high school elective completely unaware of the struggles that go into learning your first programming language, let alone if it is a monstrosity (I say with love) like C++. </p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>I was mostly just winging the elective choices at the time, and coding just sounded fun enough to try.</p>
<p>Cut to first year of college, and I am already in the CSE department with great hopes for where the future would take me. Funnily enough, the first year of an engineering degree is mostly a repetition of the stuff you study in your final years of school - which is to say, the best way to spend it was obviously to invest most of the time into a dance society (enter World of Dance championship dreams).</p>
<p>While I had a lot of hobbies, building stuff was plain <em>cool</em> like only a few other things are. </p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-app.png" alt="A random screenshot of a practice blog app"></p>
<p>Coming from a childhood love for maths, I think it only made sense to combine that with my absolute obsession with drawing at the time. And so, I started learning web development as a side project in my second year.</p>
<p>That’s when I was introduced to Google Summer of Code.</p>
<h3 id="GSoC-Days"><a href="#GSoC-Days" class="headerlink" title="GSoC Days"></a>GSoC Days</h3><p>Oh the awe with which I realised that we don’t have to be older to contribute and actually make a difference, that the world of open source is all out there and waiting for us (aka: me). I was told it was going to be a challenge, that it takes a lot of effort and is pretty hard to do if it’s already mid january and the application process starts the very next month. </p>
<p>At the time, my young and naive brain took it for a great challenge and got down to reading about different organizations and projects. Luckily for me, I ended up finding a project I genuinely liked. This meant I had to slowly start letting my presence known inside the organization - contributing to open issues, working on the backend to gain some insights, and using the product enough to take ownership and find problems that I could fix. </p>
<p>I spent a lot of time learning all about what the org did in order to come up with a kick-ass proposal. I want to say it was a piece of cake after the proposal bit, but the nerves were wrecking and as I waited impatiently, it took them quite a while to release the results. When it finally arrived (at like 2 in the night), I woke everyone up in my family to tell them the news, jumping around, literally shaking at all the possibilities. The next four months were pure magic - learning all about the open source world in itself was an experience I will always be grateful for having.</p>
<p>During GSoC, I ended up applying for the Google Women in Tech scholarship. Receiving the scholarship was even wilder, because I was one amongst only 74 across all of APAC to be awarded with the scholarship. </p>
<h3 id="And-then-there-was-MLH"><a href="#And-then-there-was-MLH" class="headerlink" title="And then there was MLH"></a>And then there was MLH</h3><p>2020 was the year of challenges and reaching for the sky - a very formative year in my ultimate career advancement. I had gotten a taste for open source and it was hard to stop. By the end of the year I had already applied to Major League Hacking Fellowship - a platform that lets you intern with some of the best open source projects leading the industry. When the fellowship program finally began in 2021, I was put in the team meant to work on Facebook’s Docusaurs and the next three months were spent gawking at just how things get done in a company of such large scale. </p>
<h3 id="Code-for-Good-Hackathon-and-Oracle"><a href="#Code-for-Good-Hackathon-and-Oracle" class="headerlink" title="Code for Good Hackathon and Oracle"></a>Code for Good Hackathon and Oracle</h3><p>In 2021, I participated in the Code for Good Hackathon conducted by JP Morgan to work on projects that would contibute towards improvement of society. The next few months I interned at Oracle to build an app to perform zoom room maintenance tasks automatically. This was a fun time that taught me about how user requirements affect user interface - ultimately building a great user experience.</p>
<p>By 2022, I had participated in JP Morgan’s Code for Good hackathon and gotten the offer for work, I had also received a pre-placement offer from Oracle. </p>
<p>I ultimately ended up joining a start-up because it sounded much more challenging, with a greater learning curve and the opportunity to build something from scratch. </p>
<h3 id="Lastly"><a href="#Lastly" class="headerlink" title="Lastly"></a>Lastly</h3><p>Looking back, each step from that first C++ class to my current role has been about embracing challenges and seeking out opportunities to learn and grow. I wouldn’t change any of it.</p>
